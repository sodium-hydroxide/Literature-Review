# General Statistics Notes
## Hypothesis Testing

When attempting to model using statistics, it is common to use hypothesis testing.

**Definition:** Null hypothesis, $H_0$, states there is no relationship between the variables being analyzed.

**Definition:** Alternative hypothesis, $H_a$ states there is a relationship between the variables being analyzed.

**In the context of radiation detection, the null hypothesis is that any measured counts are not attributable to radioactive material (radmat). The alternative hypothesis states that the measured counts are distinguishable from background radiation and are due to radmat.**

**Definition:** A priori means choosing independent of current experiments.

**Definition:** A posteriori means choosing based on information from current experiments.

There are four cases when choosing a hypothesis:

| | $H_0$ is true | $H_0$ is false|
|---|---|---|
|Fail to reject $H_0$ | Correct Inference | Type II Error: False Negative|
|Reject $H_0$ | Type I Error: False Positive | Correct Inference|

The goal is to minimize the likelihood of type 1 and type 2 error.
