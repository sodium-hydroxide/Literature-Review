@article{StatisticalConsiderationsBrandl2013,
abstract = {ABSTRACTContinuously repeated or frequent periodic measurements of the radiation environment in the absence of an identified source of ionizing radiation provide large data sets on the ambient background. Statistical evaluation of these data allows for the identification and quantification of the relevant background distribution parameters paramount to establishing a well characterized background distribution. Given this distribution, the determination of characteristic limits, such as the decision threshold, follows standard procedures. However, the data used to establish these characteristic limits contain additional information on the probabilities for future individual measurement results, which can be employed to improve the detection system capabilities for signal identification at low signal-to-background ratios. In particular, a statistical evaluation of the time history of individual, independent measurements allows for the establishment of new decision thresholds with the same prescribed probability of error of the first kind but with a lower value than the decision threshold obtained from standardized procedures. A rigorous mathematical and statistical treatment of multiple data from a well characterized background distribution is presented, together with an analysis of the relevant operational restrictions and statistical conditions for which an improved lower decision threshold can be obtained. A set of initial projections toward the application of appropriate statistical algorithms is intended to provide a basis for further investigation of these statistical considerations for their implementation in continuous scanning or screening operations or in individual or environmental monitoring programs.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have been published using Bayesian statistics in source localization and identification, characterization of radioactive samples, and uncertainty analysis; but there is a limited amount of material specific to the development of a decision threshold for simple gross count measurements using Bayesian statistics. Radiation detection in low fidelity systems is customarily accomplished through the measurement of gross counts. Difficulties arise when applying decision techniques to low count rate data, which are restricted by the fact that decisions are being made on individual gross count measurements alone. The investigation presented demonstrates a method to develop a viable Bayesian model to detect radiological sources using gross count measurements in low fidelity systems. An integral component of the research is the process required to validate a Bayesian model both statistically and operationally in Health Physics. The results describe the necessary model development, validation steps, and application to the detection of radiological sources at low signal-to-background ratios by testing the model against laboratory data. The approach may serve as a guideline for a series of requirements to integrate Bayesian modeling (specifically, an interaction model) with radiation detection using gross counts in low fidelity systems.},

@mastersthesis{detectionOfWeakRadiologicalSourceMeengsThesis2018,
abstract = {The detection of radiation requires the use of statistical tools due to the probabilistic nature of the emission and interaction properties of radiation, an analysis that includes the testing of a hypothesis regarding the presence or absence of a source against background. Traditionally, a false positive rate of 5% is used to calculate a y*, the decision threshold, above which a source is determined to be present. However, in radiological conditions where a source is both improbable and weak, and where counting time is limited, detection of a source becomes increasingly challenging using this traditional method. The detection of clandestine fissile materials presents such a challenge, and with the increasing risk of nuclear proliferation, there exists a growing desire to research more optimal methods in detecting these sources, especially where a missed detection is of such high consequence. Previous research has shown that using a string of measurements, and calculating a detection limit based on a certain number of false positives within that string, consistently outperforms the traditional method of basing the detection limit on just one measurement. Such research to date has only been applied to counts of all energies (gross counts). The purpose of this research is to apply the success of this new detection algorithm to certain energies within the spectrum, and to discover whether further optimization is possible by this process. Optimization was evaluated using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, where special emphasis was placed at the lower false positive values. Over the course of this research, two hypothesis were tested. The first hypothesis conjectures that it is indeed possible to further optimize source detection when using an energy bin other than gross counts. The second hypothesis postulates that if the first hypothesis is true, than there exists a mathematical criterion that predicts this behavior. Both hypothesis were verified to be correct.},

abstract={Illicit trafficking in nuclear materials has become more and more a problem, due to the circulation of a high number of radioactive sources and the big amount of nuclear material The IAEA database counts at present more than 300 verified cases The endangering cased thereby ranges from possible health defect for the publication to terrorists activities and production of nuclear weapons In addition to the primary criminal reasons the illegal disposal of radioactive sources as salvage, scrap and others show a further problem, which has lead to severe accidents and lethal effects in the past (eg Goiana, Mexico) Some countries have already under taken countermeasures (eg Monitoring at the Finnish-Russian and German- Polish border, border monitoring in Italy) The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reacted on this actual problem by setting up a new program to fight against nuclear criminality and has suggested a pilot study for the practical test of border monitoring systems Co-ordinated by the Federal Ministry of Economy and Labour the Austrian Government financed the pilot study ITRAP (Illicit Trafficking Radiation Detection Assessment Program) carried out by the Austrian Research Centers Seibersdorf (ARCS) Aim of the study was to work out the technical requirements and the practicability of an useful monitoring system at border crossings The results of the study will be offered by the IAEA to the member states as international recommendations for border monitoring systems},
